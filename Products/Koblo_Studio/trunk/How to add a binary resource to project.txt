How to add a binary resource to project
=======================================

In this example it's a sound file called BEEP.WAV


1) Copy BEEP.WAV to resources folder

2) Edit file recources/res.list so it includes this line:
   BEEP.WAV ID_BEEP_WAV

3) Rebuild resources by running either the _BuildResources script
   that matches your OS (extension ".bat" for windows, ".sh" for OS X).
   This will update the files "Resources.h" and "ResourcesInc.cpp".

4) In application/plugin class cpp file insert the following lines:
   // Get pointer to raw resource
   ge::IRawResource* pBeepWav = pResMan->GetRawResource(ID_BEEP_WAV);
   const void* pvoidBeepWav = (void*)pBeepWav->GetData();
   tuint64 uiSizeBeepWav = (tuint64)pBeepWav->GetDataSize();
   // Make it look like a file
   IFileMemory* pfileBeepWav = IFileMemory::Create();
   if (!pfileBeepWav->Open(IFile::FileRead, pvoidBeepWav, uiSizeBeepWav)) {
       // Something went wrong....
       // ..... do something here
   }
